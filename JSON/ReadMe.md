# JSON Training
### What is JSON
1. JSON is  a Text based std for sharing info thru' Text based Protocols like HTTP. 
2. It is light weight and Text based which can be read in a human readable format. 
3. Data will be self explanatory.
4. It is platform independent, it can be created and viewed on any platform or any electronic device. 
5. JSON has now become a popular and standard format of exchanging data on the internet. 
6. It can contain data like objects(JS Objects) and Arrays. 
### JSON and XML
1. XML was earlier the std format of exchanging data among the internet users. It stands for eXtensible Markup language. 
2. We use self descriptive tags to define the content of the document. Like HTML, U could create the tags on ur own and use them in the Applications. As it was markup content, U could not create real time data like Arrays and Objects. Things become complicated when U use nested Tags. More deeper, more problems. U explicitly need parsers to process XML data. More complex Elements need more complex logic in implementing the XML Parsers. 
3. JSON being representable as objects and Arrays which are the real time representable data, UR parsers will not be complicated and it is easily understandable. However, all REST APIs support both XML and JSON formats for data exchanging. 
4. XML has only string format, but JSON has strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects. This makes it more powerfull and adaptable. 
### Creating JSON file
Files in JSON are created with exten .json. They can contain objects, arrays and various data types that are supported in Javascript: number, string, boolean, object. 
### Object vs. Arrays
### JSON Parsing and Stringify
### JSON Server
